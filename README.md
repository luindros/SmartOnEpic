# SmartOnEpic

SmartOnEpic is a web application designed to allow patients registered in the EPIC system to access the EPIC Sandbox FHIR Server. Epic on FHIR offers developers a standardized method to build applications that interact with healthcare data via FHIR APIs.

To implement this application, we registered an account in Epic's sandbox environment and set up an app to route the web application's queries through this registered app.
